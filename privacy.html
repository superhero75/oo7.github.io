    <P>1)Email address. We ask for your email address as part of your registration.

Valid email address is also needed to retrieve a lost password and to make a VPN connection.</P>
    <P>2)Payment data. In addition to the conventional payment methods, such as credit card, users can buy OO7 service with cryptocurrency. Our payment processing partners process basic billing information for payment processing and refund requests.</P>

    <P>OO7 may process your personal data (email address) for direct marketing purposes in the following cases: when we obtain your consent to such processing (the legal basis for processing, in this case, is your consent) or when applicable law permits us to contact you without a separate consent (under the legal basis of a legitimate interest)</P>
    <h4>Your personal data protection rights</h4>

You also may request to restrict the processing of your personal data (when there is a legal basis for that).

    <p>Your data is processed under the jurisdiction of Hong Kong (SAR). If the data is processed by a designated subsidiary in your country, then the domestic law of your country may be applicable at our discretion.</p>
    <P>OO7 would like to remind you that you are yourself responsible for the security of your data. We ask you to be careful when using and storing personal data containing files on your devices, as well as the devices itself. Please ensure that nobody accesses and uses your devices without your consent.</P>
    <P>You shall be extra careful and not disclose your personal information to unrelated third parties, since such information may be used in different ways and against your interests, including activities such as fraud, invasion of privacy, identity theft, etc.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure security of the personal data, OO7 employs various administrative, technical and physical security measures, however it is your responsibility to exercise caution and reason when using the OO7 Services. You will be personally responsible if such action violates any third party’s privacy or any other rights, or any applicable law. Under no circumstances, OO7 is liable for the consequences of your unlawful activities, your willful and negligent activities violating applicable laws or third party rights, as well as any circumstances, which may not have been reasonably controlled or foreseen.</P>
    <P>This Privacy Policy may be modified and updated at any time, at our sole discretion, for any or no reason, and without liability, as indicated below. The date of the most current wording of the Privacy Policy is indicated at the top of the text. We ask all users to ensure that they are familiar with the most current wording of the Privacy Policy. The amendment of the Privacy Policy may be communicated to you by sending an email and/or by publishing the updated Privacy Policy on the OO7 website. Please consider reviewing the Privacy Policy each time you use the OO7 Services. Updates of the Privacy Policy come into force as of the moment when they are published.</P>
    <P>You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under this Privacy Policy to any third party.</P>
